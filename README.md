# Welcome to pathing, an interactive pathfinding algorithm sandbox.

## How to start:

### `1. Build your template (Grid editor)`
* Use the **box-select** tool to add/remove **individual tiles** in the grid.
* Use the **row-select** tool to add/remove full **rows** of tiles in the grid.
* Use the **column-select** tool to add/remove full **columns** of tiles in the grid.
  
### `2. Throw the algorithm a curve-ball. (Obstacle editor)`
* Use the **wall** tool to add/remove **walls** that exist on grid tiles and **block** paths.
* Use the **start-flag** tool to change the **starting position**.
* Use the **target-flag** tool to add/remove **target positions**.
* Hit the **maze** button to generate walls all over the grid in a maze pattern.
  
### `3. Pick your poison. (Algorithm selection)`
* Pick the algorithm you wish to use to solve for the shortest path to a target.
* Use the speed slider to choose the playback speed of the algorithm simulation.
* Hit play and watch the magic happen!


## Plans for the future:
* Add live annotations to help walk you through the app's features.
* Add github link from project to this repository.
